**Hey, I'm Ailakks! :D**

I am a 17-year-old developer who loves programming in Java and JavaScript. I enjoy designing websites and APIs using technologies like React and NestJS. Additionally, I have experience programming Minecraft plugins using SpigotMC and Velocity.

I have many personal projects, including some related to artificial intelligence. I have also worked for several large Minecraft servers and content creators, creating games and events that thousands of people could enjoy
